# Embedded Databases

## Introduction

Embedded databases are database management systems that are tightly integrated with the application and do not require a separate database server process. They offer high performance, low latency, and ease of use. This document compares several popular embedded databases, including BadgerDB, BoltDB, LevelDB, and RocksDB, highlighting their key features, architecture, advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.

## 1. BadgerDB
